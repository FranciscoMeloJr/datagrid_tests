### Data Grid 8 

Data Grid is a high-performance, distributed in-memory data store:
1. Schemaless data structure --> key - entry 
2. Flexibility to store different objects as key-value pairs.
3. Grid-based data storage
4. Designed to distribute and replicate data across clusters.
5. Elastic scaling
6. Dynamically adjust the number of nodes to meet demand without service disruption.
7. Data interoperability

Store, retrieve, and query data in the grid from different endpoints.
